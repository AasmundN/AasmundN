## Hey devs!

Welcome to my github account! I am a fourth year student at the [Norwegian University of Science and Technology](https://www.ntnu.no/), specializing within design of embedded and digital systems. When I'm not studying I work as a developer in my startup company [Company of Things](cot.as), as well as miscellaneous side projects within embedded systems engineering.
