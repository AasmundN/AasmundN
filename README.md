## Hey devs!

Welcome to my github account! I am a fifth year student at the [Norwegian University of Science and Technology](https://www.ntnu.no/), specializing within design of embedded and digital systems. I am currently working on my master thesis for the Small satellite lab at NTNU IES. As part of the Hypso Satellite project I am implementing a high throughput FPGA implementation of the CCSDS 123.0 B-2 algorithm for compression of hyperspectral images. When I'm not studying I work as a developer in my startup company [Company of Things](https://cot.as), as well as miscellaneous side projects within embedded systems engineering.
